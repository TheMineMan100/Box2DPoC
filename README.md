# Installation instructions

This repo was made with Visual Studio, and more specifically vcpkg in mind. Be sure to run `vcpkg install` in the developer console to install the Box2D and SFML libraries.

# Features

Through the Physics.hpp header file the box2dPoc.cpp file has access to several prewritten methods for easier access of certain Box2D functions, such as creating static or dynamic boxes, circles and more.
These shapes and their movements are visualized through the use of the SFML library.
